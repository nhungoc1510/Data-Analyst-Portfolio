# Ngoc Nhan - Data Analyst Portfolio

## The introduction
Hi, I'm Ngoc! I am currently completing a Data Analyst training program at MindX Technology School, with the goal of becoming a professional data analyst. My background is in Architecture from Van Lang University, which has given me a strong sense of structure, design thinking, and problem-solving.

During my studies, I have worked on some data-related projects (detailed below) that allowed me to apply data processing and management, analysis, visualization techniques, presentation skill, statistical analysis, and other critical ability. These hands-on experiences have helped me build a solid foundation in data analytics and sparked a passion for uncovering insights from data. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets as a data analyst.

In my spare time, I am continuously working to improve my technical skills, including SQL, Python, Excel, Power BI, data storytelling, and other essential tools, techniques to expand my knowledge and skills. I am motivated by the excitement of uncovering insights and the fulfillment that comes from solving complex problems with data, whether collaborating in a team or working independently.

This is my CV in [pdf](https://github.com/nhungoc1510/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/CV_NHAN-NHU-NGOC.pdf).

This space is where I share my progress, showcase my projects, and reflect on my journey into the world of data.

## Portfolio Projects
>This section highlights my data analytics projects along with a brief overview of the tools and technologies used in each case.

### Analysis and evaluation of Airbnb operations in New York
*This is a project I did with my team where I analyzed and evaluated Airbnb operations in New York.*

- **Code**: [Airbnb-Project.ipynb](https://github.com/nhungoc1510/Projects/blob/main/Airbnb-Project.ipynb)
- **Goal**: To evaluate Airbnb listing performance across NYC neighborhoods.
- **Description**: Analyzed AB_NYC_2019 dataset with 48,896 records. Cleaned data, explored listing distribution, room types, prices, availability, and reviews. Used maps and charts to visualize trends and identify high-demand areas.
- **Skills**: data cleaning, EDA, geospatial analysis, visualization.
- **Technology**: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, PowerBI.
- **Results**: Found Manhattan and Brooklyn had highest demand and lowest vacancy. Entire home/apt listings were most expensive; private rooms were most booked. Suggested investment focus on high-demand zones.

### Issue and solutions related to room cancellations
*This is a project I did personally where I figured out the issue and brought solutions related to room cancellations.*

- **Code**: [Churn-Project.ipynb](https://github.com/nhungoc1510/Projects/blob/main/Churn-Project.ipynb)
- **Goal**: Understand the reasons for customer cancellations and predict future room cancellation trends.
- **Description**: Analyzed hotel_booking dataset with 119,390 records. Divided 36 columns into 3 main groups for analysis purposes: Customer, booking procedure and service segment. Cleaning data by removing null, duplicates, and hiding unnecessary columns. Used charts to visualize and find solutions.
- **Skills**: data cleaning, EDA, geospatial analysis, visualization.
- **Technology**: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy, PowerBI.
- **Results**: Hotels can effectively predict trends and understand cancellation reasons using booking data. To enhance online customer acquisition, they should also gather more guest feedback and online reviews, and actively engage with guests to encourage positive comments.
