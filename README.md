## Project 1: Analysis and evaluation of Airbnb operations in New York

*This is a project I did with my team for my final project in Level 1 at MindX Technology School, where I analyzed and evaluated Airbnb operations in New York.*

⚡️Data was taken from Kaggle, the project analyzes Airbnb activity in New York using the AB_NYC_2019 dataset (16 columns, ~49K rows).
⚡️Use Python for Data cleaning 
⚡️Data Analysis & Evaluation: 
     Visualized total listings and hosts
     Geographical Analysis: Used latitude and longitude to plot map
     Price Analysis
     Room Type Analysis
     Supply & Demand Analysis
⚡️Conclusion: Airbnb remains a popular lodging choice thanks to its flexible pricing, diverse room types, and unique experiences. Among all areas, Manhattan and Brooklyn stand out as the best locations for investment due to consistently high demand. Pricing is influenced more by room type than location, allowing hosts to stay competitive across neighborhoods. Additionally, metrics like review counts and minimum stay durations provide valuable insights into customer preferences, helping guide smarter investment and hosting decisions.
