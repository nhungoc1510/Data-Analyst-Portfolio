# Ngoc Nhan - Data Analyst Portfolio

## The introduction
Hi, I'm Ngoc! I am currently completing a Data Analyst training program at MindX Technology School, with the goal of becoming a professional data analyst. My background is in Architecture from Van Lang University, which has given me a strong sense of structure, design thinking, and problem-solving.

During my studies, I have worked on some data-related projects (detailed below) that allowed me to apply data processing and management, analysis, visualization techniques, presentation skill, statistical analysis, and other critical ability. These hands-on experiences have helped me build a solid foundation in data analytics and sparked a passion for uncovering insights from data. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets as a data analyst.

In my spare time, I am continuously working to improve my technical skills, including SQL, Python, Excel, Power BI, data storytelling, and other essential tools, techniques to expand my knowledge and skills. I am motivated by the excitement of uncovering insights and the fulfillment that comes from solving complex problems with data, whether collaborating in a team or working independently.

This is my CV in [pdf](https://github.com/nhungoc1510/nhungoc/edit/main/README.md).

This space is where I share my progress, showcase my projects, and reflect on my journey into the world of data.

## Portfolio Projects
>This section highlights my data analytics projects along with a brief overview of the tools and technologies used in each case.

### Project 1: Analysis and evaluation of Airbnb operations in New York (Study Project)
*This is a project I did with my team where I analyzed and evaluated Airbnb operations in New York.*

- **Goal**: To evaluate Airbnb listing performance across NYC neighborhoods.
- **Description**: Analyzed AB_NYC_2019 dataset with 48,896 records. Cleaned data, explored listing distribution, room types, prices, availability, and reviews. Used maps and charts to visualize trends and identify high-demand areas.
- **Skills**: data cleaning, EDA, geospatial analysis, visualization.
- **Technology**: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, PowerBI.
- **Results**: Found Manhattan and Brooklyn had highest demand and lowest vacancy. Entire home/apt listings were most expensive; private rooms were most booked. Suggested investment focus on high-demand zones.
